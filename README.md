# Anti Procrastination hosts file for uBlock and Windows..
To avoid procrastination, these hosts files blocks garbage sites designed to waste your time and your miserable life. I created these for personal use, to link to uBlock Origin, but sharing is caring, so enjoy. 

Keep in mind, depending upon the hosts file you use, some sites like Reddit, Twitter and YouTube are left unblocked cause they are needed for "work" these days (necessary evil).

## Which hosts file to use?
[anti-procrastination-hosts-file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero5zero6zero7/anti-procrastination-hosts-file/main/anti-procrastination-hosts-file) doesn't block Twitter, YouTube and Reddit.

[anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero5zero6zero7/anti-procrastination-hosts-file/main/anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS) blocks Twitter.

[anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS-ULTRA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero5zero6zero7/anti-procrastination-hosts-file/main/anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS-ULTRA) blocks Twitter, Reddit and YouTube.

All hosts files only differ in blocking Twitter, Reddit and YouTube. Rest of the blocks remain the same. I personally use [anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero5zero6zero7/anti-procrastination-hosts-file/main/anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS).

## What does this host file block?
From porn sites to news sites doing nothing but spreading doom and gloom 24/7. Personally, when I started cutting Twitter and news sites from my life, I realized I had a lot of time to do other things, like read books or learn something new. If you are so desperate to increase your blood pressure and feel depressed about the world, feel free to unblock news sources.

As for porn, even Twitter is pretty much a porn paradise, but ONLY when you follow people who do porn or someone you follow is following such pornographic accounts. Unfollow those people and block porn "stars" if you don't want to see porn on Twitter. I generally avoid Twitter but never follow porn related content on my account, so this is why Twitter isn't blocked. Instagram on the other hand is 99% porn and 1% content nobody cares about. So it gets blocked.

Do note, I'm an atheist. Blocking porn has nothing to do with "religious reasons". If you want to waste your life jacking it to a bunch of pixels you'll never meet or hold in real life, feel free to unlblock your favorite porn sites.

Fun fact. While searching for top porn sites to block, found so many "health" rags linking to "TOP PORN SITES FOR MEN/WOMEN" or nonsense like "SAFE PORN FOR WOMEN". WTF is even safe porn? Is it like a Unicorn? Love how these "men health" online sites promote porn. A lot of porn sites actually call themselves "safe porn" while being run by same few adult content conglomerates that create the "unsafe porn". 

Also, '/r/noFap' on Reddit is a incredibly stupid subreddit. I think it'll actually turn people to jacking off more seeing the cringeness at display there.

## Are these hosts originally compiled by you? What about updates?
No, I have combined multiple other hosts files into one "mega" file for my personal use. I do end up adding custom sites here and there to the list though. Use this if you're a game developer or a writer and want a more "curated" online experience. A lot of sites for reference, 3D models, discussions, etc., are left unblocked. Whole reason I'm adding this to Github is to make it easy to add it to [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin).

RAW files will keep getting updated. I've been using these hosts for years so I keep adding more pointless garbage to block, especially these days thanks to Covid when most of us are glued to computers 24/7.

## uBlock Origin vs Windows system HOSTS file block, which is better?
Personally, I use both, however I tend to move some hosts to uBlock only on Firefox (or Chrome). uBlock allows you to temporarily unblock a host, or just disabling uBlock on that site will allow you to browse it. Host file block on Windows makes it harder and sometimes, you'll be forced to restart system to unblock a domain completely or even edit the host file. Do note, using Windows hosts will block any app from connecting to the domain blocked in hosts file. This is pretty useful to disallow ANY app from connecting to a specific domain (especially malware).

# Use Hostman to edit Windows HOSTS.
>You can also use a freeware app like [Hostman](https://www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman/) to edit, manage and update Windows hosts. Makes sure to create backups of default HOSTS file first. You won't have to manually add "127.0.0.1" to hosts when using an app like this to edit/manage hosts. I've been using this for years (though development seems to have stopped). It works fine on my Windows 10 LTSC.
