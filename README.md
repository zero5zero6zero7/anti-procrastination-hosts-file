# Anti Procrastination hosts file for uBlock and Windows..
Host file collection created primarily for linking to my uBlock Origin add-on in various browsers I use. List primarily created to avoid procrastination, blocks garbage sites designed to waste your time. Do note, some sites like Reddit, Twitter and YouTube are left unblocked cause they are needed for "work" these days (necessary evil).

## What does this host file block?
Primarily, porn sites or sites that are borderline softcore porn sites these days (Instagram). 

Do note, even Twitter is pretty much a porn paradise, but ONLY when you follow people who do porn or someone you follow is following such pornographic accounts. Unfollow those people and block porn "stars" if you don't want to see porn on Twitter. I generally avoid Twitter but never follow porn related content on my account, so this is why Twitter isn't blocked. 

Instagram on the other hand is 99% porn and 1% content nobody cares about. So it gets blocked.

## Is this list originally created by you?
No, I'm combining multiple other host files into one "mega" file for my personal use. I do end up adding custom sites here and there to the list though. Use this if you're a game developer or a writer and want a more "curated" online experience. A lot of sites for reference, 3D models, discussions, etc., are left unblocked.

## uBlock Origin vs Windows system HOSTS file block, which is better?
Personally, I use both, however I tend to move some hosts to uBlock only on Firefox (or Chrome). uBlock allows you to temporarily unblock a host, or just disabling uBlock on that site will allow you to browse it. Host file block on Windows makes it harder and sometimes, you'll be forced to restart system to unblock a domain completely or even edit the host file. Do note, using Windows hosts will block any app from connecting to the domain blocked in hosts file. This is pretty useful to disallow ANY app from connecting to a specific domain (especially malware).

## What is [anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero5zero6zero7/anti-procrastination-hosts-file/main/anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS)"?
Mostly same as [anti-procrastination-hosts-file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero5zero6zero7/anti-procrastination-hosts-file/main/anti-procrastination-hosts-file), except it also blocks Twitter along with a lot of main news and social sites. Sites like Reddit and YouTube are still unblocked, because these sites are actually useful for work and "research". Use [anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS-ULTRA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero5zero6zero7/anti-procrastination-hosts-file/main/anti-procrastination-hosts-file-XS-ULTRA) host file to block Reddit and YouTube as well.
