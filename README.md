# mega-anti-everything-hosts-file
Host file collection created primarily for linking to my uBlock Origin add-on in various browsers I use. List primarily created to avoid procrastination, blocks garbage sites designed to waste your time. Do note, some sites like Reddit, Twitter and YouTube are left unblocked cause they are needed for "work" these days (necessary evil).
