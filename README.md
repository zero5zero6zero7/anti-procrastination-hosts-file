# mega-anti-everything-hosts-file
Host file collection created primarily for linking to my uBlock Origin add-on in various browsers I use. List primarily created to avoid procrastination, blocks garbage sites designed to waste your time. Do note, some sites like Reddit, Twitter and YouTube are left unblocked cause they are needed for "work" these days (necessary evil).


<h1>What does this host file block?</h1>
Primarily, porn sites or sites that are borderline softcore porn sites these days (Instagram). 

Do note, even Twitter is pretty much a porn paradise, but ONLY when you follow people who do porn or someone you follow is following such pornographic accounts. Unfollow those people and block porn "stars" if you don't want to see porn on Twitter. I generally avoid Twitter but never follow porn related content on my account, so this is why Twitter isn't blocked. 

Instagram on the other hand is 99% porn and 1% content nobody cares about. So it gets blocked.


<h1>Is this list originally created by you?</h1>
No, I'm combining multiple other host files into one "mega" file. I'll link to them properly, in time (mostly because want to be sure most of these lists are legit before linking to them).


<h1>How to add this host file to uBlock Origin?</h1>
1. Open uBlock Settings
2. Select the "Filter Lists" tab, scroll down to the end.
3. Under "Custom" section, checkbox "Import" and paste the URL of the RAW host list: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero5zero6zero7/mega-anti-everything-hosts-file/main/mega-anti-everything-hosts-file
4. Purge all cache, update and apply changes. Done.
